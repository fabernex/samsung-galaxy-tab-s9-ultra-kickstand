# Background

I really loved the [Microsoft Surface Pro kickstand](media/surface-pro-9-animation-video-desktop.mp4), with it's variable angle and low profile. When I got a Galaxy Tab S9 ultra, I was disappointed to see there wasn't an affordable option - Samsung's own [Book Cover Keyboard](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/tablets/galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-book-cover-keyboard-ef-dx915ubeguj/) costs $350 currently, and I did not want to shell out that much on an already expensive tablet - plus I didn't care about the keyboard.

# Design Process

1. Mapped out the magnets using magnet paper and some post-its
	- [magnet locations](media/s9-ultra-magnets.jpg)
2. Brought that into Fusion 360 to design and iterate
	 - [Fusion assembly](https://a360.co/3OwZ8lM)
	 - [Fusion f3d file](./galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-kickstand.f3d)
