# Background

I really loved the Microsoft Surface Pro kickstand, with it's variable angle and low profile. When I got a Galaxy Tab S9 ultra, I was disappointed to see there wasn't an affordable option - Samsung's own [Book Cover Keyboard](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/tablets/galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-book-cover-keyboard-ef-dx915ubeguj/) costs $350 currently, and I did not want to shell out that much on an already expensive tablet - plus I didn't care about the keyboard.


# Design Process

1. Mapped out the magnets using magnet paper and some post-its

2. Brought that into Fusion 360 to design and iterate
